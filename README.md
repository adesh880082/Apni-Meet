## **Project Description**

The video conference app project, APNI-MEET, is an innovative and advanced solution that aims to transform virtual communication experiences. The app is designed to provide a seamless and user-friendly platform for individuals, teams, and organizations to connect, collaborate, and conduct meetings remotely
To facilitate effective collaboration, APNI-MEET incorporates a range of essential tools. Participants can easily share their screens, documents, and presentations during meetings, allowing for real-time information sharing and discussions.

***Objective***

1. Seamless Virtual Communication: The primary objective of the video conference app project is to provide a seamless and immersive virtual communication experience. The app aims to overcome the limitations of traditional communication methods and enable individuals, teams, and organizations to connect, collaborate, and conduct meetings remotely as if they were in the same physical location.

2. High-Quality Video and Audio: The project seeks to deliver high-quality video and crystal-clear audio to ensure effective communication during virtual meetings. By leveraging advanced technologies and video codecs, the app aims to provide participants with a lifelike meeting experience, enabling them to see and hear each other with clarity and precision.

3. User-Friendly Interface: The video conference app project focuses on creating a user-friendly interface that is intuitive and easy to navigate. The objective is to ensure that users of all technical backgrounds can use the app effortlessly, without the need for extensive training or technical support.

4. Cross-Platform Compatibility: The project aims to develop a video conference app that is compatible with various devices and operating systems. Whether it's smartphones, tablets, laptops, or desktop computers, the objective is to enable users to connect and collaborate seamlessly across different platforms, promoting flexibility and accessibility.
## ***GUI tools and its importance***

Graphical User Interface helps users to interact graphically with the computer i.e. a user can use different graphical capability such as text, mouse and picture to communicate with the computer.

***The GUI divided into following types:***

1. Front-End: The end is visible to the user and responsible for interactive with the user. The front end is responsible for receiving user’s queries, passing it over to the backend. The front–end includes graphical user interface. Apart from the user interface, the frond-end also contains database objects that form a layer between the user interface and the backend. Ex: Java, C#, VB, VC++, .NET.

2. Back-end: This end is not visible to the user but it performs all database–related tasks in the background. It receives user’s queries and passes them to the database server. After processing the user’s requests and queries, the server returns the results to the backend that passes it to the front-end. Ex: MS-ACCESS, ORACLE, SQL SERVER ,FIREBASE.

***Importance of GUI Application:***

1. It is user friendly
2. It frees user from the internal working of the system.
3. It performs maximum of work, while requiring a minimum of   information from users.
## ***Front end***

**Elastic UI**

The Elastic UI Framework (EUI) is a design library in use at Elastic to build React applications that need to share our branding and aesthetics. It distributes typed UI React components and static assets for use in building web layouts. Alongside the React components, we ship theme & style utilities that can be used independently on their own.

The primary goal of this library is to provide reusable UI components that can be used throughout Elastic's web products. As React components, they remove CSS from the process of building UIs. As a single source of truth, the framework allows our designers to make changes to our aesthetic directly in the code. And unit test coverage for the UI components allows us to deliver a stable "API for user interfaces".
## ***Back End***

Firebase is the Firebase Cloud messaging software cross-platform. It is also known as Google Cloud Messaging it was developed by Andrew Lee and James Tamplin in 2011.

Firebase provides cloud service, server and real-time backend server. API for the clients also helps to develop high quality applications.

Most importantly, Firebase is a NoSQL database in which data is stored in a cloud /32/33/34/35/37/. When full-fledged application is built, you have to rely on the backend service as well.

Therefore, Firebase is a good choice because it saves time and allows you to focus on development. It stores the data in JSON file or JSON objects and we do not need to write any server codes, but it is ready-made API for developing and implementation of applications.

## User manual for **Apni-Meet**

We can start our APNI-MEET by login with google account from login page which will redirect us to the dashboard after successful login .

From dashboard we can go on the create meeting page by clicking on create meeting card which will redirect us on create meeting page where we can click on one on one meeting or video conference to create the meet as per our requirement.

We can click on meetings card which will redirect us to the meetings page where all the meeting created by user are listed and we can edit the meetings also.

We can click on meetings card on dashboard to which will redirect the user to the my meetings page where all the meetings are listed (which is created by user or the meetings in which user is invited).

Finally we can click on join now button to join the meeting or start the conference.
## ***Conclusion***

In conclusion, the APNI-MEET has been successfully developed and implemented, providing users with a reliable and user-friendly platform for conducting remote meetings and collaborations. The app has demonstrated its effectiveness in bridging the geographical gaps, enabling seamless communication and enhancing productivity for individuals and businesses alike. Throughout the development process, we focused on key factors such as security, scalability, and user experience, resulting in a robust and feature-rich application.

The app offers a range of essential features, including high-quality video and audio streaming, screen sharing, chat functionality, and participant management. It has been tested rigorously to ensure stability and compatibility across various devices and operating systems. Furthermore, the integration of advanced security measures, such as end-to-end encryption and user authentication, safeguards sensitive information and protects the privacy of users.
